Hello fellow Programmer to use my develop system first thing first you need to download and install the Xampp Server
after installation here is the step you need to do:

Step 1: Download the ZipFile "petshop" and the database aswell.

Step 2: Extract the Zipfile "petshop" then move the folder "petshop" to "C:drive/xampp/htdocs/".

Step 3: After you move the folder to htdocs open the xampp server then click the button "start" of Apache and MySQL.

Step 4: After you start the Apache and MySQL, click the button "admin" of MySQL it will direct you to "phpMyAdmin".

Step 5: On the sidebar or "phpMyAdmin" click new then create a database and name it bark88.

Step 6: Import the database you download with name "bark88".

Step 7: after you import the database now search in the URL "http://localhost/petshop/index.html"

Step 8: to login you can use my default account username: Jalexx and pass cvsu101


Thank you for being here! This project has saved me from my Capstone project and successfully defended 2 times and my overnight coding payoffs.
